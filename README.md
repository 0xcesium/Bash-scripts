# Bash-scripts
Bash scripts for different purposes, notably :

##
* A script to parse file logs of sniffer (NetScout).
##
* Regenerating RSA Keys of ~/.ssh/known_hosts when a MITM is issued.
##
* A very compact 2 lines script using sed to update just the IP of a hostname in /etc/hosts.
##
* A Color Tab with values to use in Linux Consoles in general.
